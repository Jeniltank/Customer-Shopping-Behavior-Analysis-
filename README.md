To ensure quality and reliability, the following steps were performed:

* Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
* Treated missing values (mean/median/most-frequent methods)
* Converted object types into numeric/categorical formats
* Created new features such as *age groups*
* Standardized labels and categories

These steps ensure the data is consistent, clean, and ready for analysis.
